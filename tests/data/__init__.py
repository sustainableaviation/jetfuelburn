# In Switzerland, only "intellectual creations with individual character" are protected by copyright law.
# Only Swiss copyright law applies, since the United States and Switzerland are parties to the Berne Convention
# which states that the extent of copyright protection is governed exclusively by the laws of the country where protection is claimed.
