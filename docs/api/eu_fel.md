# EU Flight Emissions Label (FEL)

## Overview

The [EU Flight Emissions Label (FEL)](https://www.flightemissions.eu/en) is a voluntary environmental labelling scheme established under [Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2405/oj/eng). The label discloses CO₂-equivalent emissions for commercial flights departing from or arriving at EU airports, covering all flights operated by participating airlines.

As of now, participation is voluntary. Once an operator chooses to take part, the FEL must be displayed for all flights in scope, ensuring consistent and non-selective reporting across its network.

The FEL is implemented by EASA through its [Sustainability Portal](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/environment/sustainability-portal) and uses verified operational data such as fuel burn, passenger load, and SAF share to generate per-flight emissions metrics.

## Label Structure

Each FEL record represents a unique combination:  
`(operator, aircraft_type, configuration, route, season, year)`  

| Metric | Unit | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **CO₂e footprint** | *kg CO₂e / passenger* | Total well-to-wake emissions per passenger |
| **CO₂e efficiency** | *g CO₂e / pax km* | Emissions per passenger-kilometre (great-circle distance basis) |
| **fuel LCE intensity** | *g CO₂e / MJ* | Weighted life-cycle carbon intensity of all fuels uplifted (Jet A-1 + SAF) |

    >  
    > (2) “Labels issued pursuant to this Article shall apply to aircraft operators falling within the scope of this Regulation for flights covered by this Regulation departing from Union airports. Where an aircraft operator requests the issuance of a label under this Article, it shall request such a label for all its flights covered by this Regulation departing from Union airports.”  
    >

    > (Preamble) “This Annex lays down the methodology and the necessary steps that the Agency shall follow for the estimation of flight emissions.”  
    >  
    > § 1 Abs. 1 “Flight emissions shall be calculated by multiplying the estimated consumption of aviation fuels … by the weighted average of lifecycle emissions of the aviation fuels uplifted at the departure airport. At the same time, flight emissions are equal to the sum of cabin and freight emissions.”

    >  
    > § 1 Abs. 3 lit. b) “If primary data for the scheduled flights does not exist, is insufficient, cannot be verified or exists only for operating conditions significantly differing from those reported, the estimated aviation fuels consumption shall be calculated by approximation using the Breguet-Range equation.”  
    >  
    > …  
    >  
    > § 2 Abs. 1 “Flight emissions shall be attributed to the cabin and to freight on the basis of the respective apportionment of cabin and freight mass.”

!!! note "Integration with Google’s Travel Impact Model"
    The Travel Impact Model (TIM) integrates the EU Flight Emissions Label (FEL) through its distribution network, ensuring interoperability between the two methodologies. For flights with FEL data issued by EASA, these verified values replace TIM estimates and are clearly marked as “EASA” to indicate the source. For more information, see the [Flight Emissions Label section of the Travel Impact Model documentation](https://github.com/google/travel-impact-model?tab=readme-ov-file#flight-emissions-label).
