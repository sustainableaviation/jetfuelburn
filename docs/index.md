# JetFuelBurn

`jetfuelburn` is a Python package for calculating fuel burn in aircraft. It is designed to be used in the context of environmental impact assessment of air travel, aircraft performance analysis and optimisation.

The package implements different fuel burn models. Some are based on basic aerodynamic equations like the [Breguet range equation](), while others are more complex and take into account the specifics of different aircraft types.

Extensive documentation is provided for each function. The package is designed to be used with physical unit through `pint`. Functions always return 

The package also includes helper function for basic atmospheric physics and the allocation of fuel burn to different cabin classes (economym, business, etc.).
