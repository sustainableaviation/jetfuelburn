The `jetfuelburn` package was written by [Michael Weinold](https://github.com/michaelweinold?tab=repositories) as part of his doctoral research at ETH Zurich and Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Funding was provided by the Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse through the ["WISER" Flagship Project](https://wiser-climate.com).
