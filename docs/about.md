# About

The `jetfuelburn` package was written by [Michael Weinold](https://github.com/michaelweinold?tab=repositories) under the supervision of [Prof. Russell McKenna](https://esc.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.mckenna.html) as part of his doctoral research at ETH Zurich and Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI).

Funding was provided by the Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse through the ["WISER" Flagship Project](https://wiser-climate.com).
