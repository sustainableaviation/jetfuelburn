    Given a flight distance (=range) $R$ and aircraft performance parameters (see table),
    returns the fuel mass burned during the flight $m_f$ [kg] based on the Breguet range equation.

    $$
        m_f = (e^{\frac{R \cdot TSFC \cdot g}{L/D \cdot v}} - 1 ) m_2
    $$

    where:

    | Symbol     | Dimension         | Description                                                            |
    |------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | $m_{fuel}$ | [mass]            | Fuel required for the mission of the aircraft                          |
    | $R$        | [distance]        | Range of the aircraft (=mission distance)                              |
    | $TSFC$     | [time/distance]   | Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption of the aircraft during cruise         |
    | $g$        | [acceleration]    | Acceleration due to gravity                                            |
    | $L/D$      | [dimensionless]   | Lift-to-Drag ratio of the aircraft                                     |
    | $v$        | [speed]           | Average cruise speed of the aircraft (TAS)                             |
    | $m_2$      | [mass]            | Mass of the aircraft after cruise segment                              |

    Note that thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) is of dimension [time/distance], as the commonly used unit [g/kNs] simplifies accordingly.

    Notes
    -----
    Key assumptions of this fuel calculation function:

    | Parameter         | Assumption                                                                 |
    |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | data availability | adequate for both current aircraft (reports) and future aircraft (studies) |
    | aircraft payload  | variable                                                                   |
    | climb/descent     | not considered, only cruise-phase                                          |
    | fuel reserves     | can be considered through $m_2$                                            |
    | alternate airport | can be considered through $m_2$                                            |

    Warnings
    --------
    Like any adaption of the range equation, this fuel calculation function represents a simplification of actual flight dynamics.
    Specifically, this function implements the Breguet range equation under the assumption of
    constant-airspeed and constant-lift-coefficient flight (cf. Young (2018), Sec. 13.7.2).
