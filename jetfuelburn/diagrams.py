    r"""
    Given aircraft performance parameters from a payload/range diagram and a flight distance $d$,
    calculates the required fuel mass $m_F$ and payload mass $m_{PL}$ for a given mission.

    This function implements the simple _"reading fuel mass off the payload/range diagram directly"_ method:

    ![Payload/Range Diagram](../_static/payload_range_generic.svg)
    Payload/Range diagram of the Airbus A350-900 (data derived [from manufacturer information](https://web.archive.org/web/20211129144142/https://www.airbus.com/sites/g/files/jlcbta136/files/2021-11/Airbus-Commercial-Aircraft-AC-A350-900-1000.pdf)).
    Note that in this figure, the y-axis shows _total_ aircraft weight, not _payload weight_.
    Total aircraft weight can be computed by adding the operating empty weight (OEW) to the payload weight and fuel weight.

    Notes
    -----
    Key assumptions of this fuel calculation function:

    | Parameter         | Assumption                                                          |
    |-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | data availability | excellent for existing aircraft (payload/range diagrams are public) |
    | aircraft payload  | maximum payload possible payload                                    |
    | climb/descent     | implicitly considered                                               |
    | fuel reserves     | depends on (sometimes unknown) manufacturer assumptions             |
    | alternate airport | depends on (sometimes unknown) manufacturer assumptions             |
    
    Warnings
    --------
    There is no manufacturer-independent convention for including
    reserve and alternate fuel in payload/range diagrams.
    Limited evidence suggests that eg. Boeing always assumes a 200nmi diversion distance (cf. [Slide 43 in this Boeing presentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/http://aviation.itu.edu.tr//img/aviation/datafiles/Lecture%20Notes/FundamentalsofAirlineManagement20152016/Lecture%20Notes/10.1-ITU_Airplane_Performance.pdf) and [this airliners.net discussion](https://www.airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=764183#p11029989)).
    The user is therefore cautioned against directly comparing aircraft of different manufacturers using this function.
